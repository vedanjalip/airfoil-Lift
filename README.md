# airfoil-Lift

This project estimates the lift force per unit wingspan acting on an airfoil (ARA - D 13%).

<br>
The lift force is calculated using the following equation:
<br>
The lift force (\(F_{\text{lift}}\)) acting on an airfoil can be approximated using the following equation:

\[ F_{\text{lift}} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot C_L \cdot \rho \cdot V^2 \cdot A \]
<br>
Where:
- \(C_L\) is the coefficient of lift for the airfoil.
- \(\rho\) is the air density.
- \(V\) is the velocity of the airflow relative to the airfoil.
- \(A\) is the reference area (wing area).

## Conditions

Elevation of airfoil above sea level = 10000 m    
<br>
Ambient Temperature (ISA)            = 223.252 K      
<br>
Ambient Pressure (ISA)               = 2644.527 N/m^-2
